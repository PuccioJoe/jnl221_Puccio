	<h2> Justin Thomas gives insight on Tiger Woods' future. </h2>

	<p> by <strong>Ben Morse, CNN</strong> </p>

	<p> (CNN) - <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/21/golf/tiger-woods-ryder-cup-spt-intl/index.html">Tiger Woods</a> has not appeared publicly on the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/08/golf/lydia-ko-atthaya-thitikul-saudi-ladies-international-spt-intl/index.html">golf</a> course since his February car accident, but fellow pro Justin Thomas says the 15-time <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/21/golf/xander-schauffele-gold-medal-olympics-spt-intl/index.html">major</a> winner will try to return if it's possible. <br><br>

Woods suffered serious leg injuries in a single-vehicle rollover accident near Los Angeles on February 23, when his SUV crossed a median, went across two lanes of road, then hit a tree and landed on the driver's side in the brush. <br><br>

Recent photos of Woods attending one of his son's golf tournaments showed him standing without crutches and had his fans wondering if he'd ever grace the course again. <br><br>

But Thomas -- who said he tries to visit Woods a couple of times a week at his South Florida home -- admits he's unsure about whether Woods will attempt a comeback.<br><br>

"I don't know. I mean, I know that he's going to try," the 2017 PGA Championship winner <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/news/2021/11/12/justin-thomas-says-tiger-woods-could-play-pga-tour-again.html">said</a> on the "No Laying Up" podcast.<br><br>

"I don't see him ever playing if he can't play well. He doesn't strike me as a guy who's played at home and he's shooting a bunch of 75s and 76s and he's like: 'OK, I'm going to give Augusta a try this year.' That's not really going to be him, at least from my understanding, what I know of him."<br><br>

Thomas added: "He knows that there's a pretty good chance that that was the last chance he really ever had, before that, of making another run. But at the same time, I know how determined he is and I know he's going to want to at least try to give something again."
Woods himself hasn't provided many updates since his accident in February.<br><br>

The 45-year-old <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COBhSUNj95S/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">shared</a> a photo of himself walking on crutches and in May, and he <a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/tiger-woods-speaks-about-recovery">told Golf Digest</a> that his physical rehabilitation has been "more painful than anything I've ever experienced."<br><br>

He's had to come back from injuries in the past, returning from spinal fusion surgery in 2017 to win the Masters in 2019.<br><br>

However, Thomas revealed that Woods has been able to remain positive and maintain his personality throughout his journey.<br><br>

<p> "Obviously I hope he does [return]. But at the same time, as I said after the accident, as long as he can be a dad and be normal with that again, that's the No. 1 priority, and the rest of this is a bonus. <br><br>

"He's still his sarcastic-ass self, so nothing has changed there, so I'm glad to see that he's still chipper as always."<br><br>

Woods is scheduled to host his Hero World Challenge on December 2-5 in the Bahamas. <br><br>
